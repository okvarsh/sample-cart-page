# sample-cart-page
A cart page designed using HTML, CSS.
PHP to connect with backend.
Backend using MySQL.

I hosted this webpage on Xampp server.
Refer to tblproduct.sql for MySQL queries.

If you're using xampp,
XAMPP->htdocs-> [create your folder('sample')] -> paste the downloaded codes
In dbcontroller.php, $database = "foldername" ex: "sample"

Start Apache, MySQL.
Open MySQL Admin.
In phpMyAdmin, create a database called 'sample' first.
Then, execute the SQL queries.
tblproduct table can be edited wrt to one's needs.

Type http://localhost/sample/simple-php-shopping-cart/index.php to view the cart page.

The colours and fonts can be formatted in style.css.

Thank you!
